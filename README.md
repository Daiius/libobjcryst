# A clone of libobjcryst for Windows and Python3
This is a modified version of https://github.com/diffpy/libobjcryst

## Main differences from the original
- Windows MSVC compilers compatibility
- Python3 compatibility
- No Anaconda related configurations

Last one might be a large gap between original one.
This is a main reason this is a clone, not a fork.
